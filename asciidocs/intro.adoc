= Introduction

== Basic concepts

Nextflow is a workflow orchestration engine and a domain specific language (DSL)
that makes it easy to write data-intensive computational pipelines.

It is designed around the idea that the Linux platform is the _lingua franca_ of data science.
Linux provides many simple but powerful command-line and scripting tools that, when chained together,
facilitate complex data manipulations.

Nextflow extends this approach, adding the ability to define complex program interactions and a
high-level parallel computational environment based on the dataflow programming model. Nextflow's
core features are:

* Workflow portability & reproducibility
* Scalability of parallelization and deployment
* Integration of existing tools, systems & industry standards

=== Processes and Channels

In practice, a Nextflow pipeline is made by joining together different processes.
Each `process` can be written in any scripting language that can be executed by the Linux platform

(Bash, Perl, Ruby, Python, etc.).

Processes are executed independently and are isolated from each other, i.e. they do not share a common
(writable) state. The only way they can communicate is via asynchronous first-in, first-out (FIFO) queues, called
`channels` in Nextflow.

Any `process` can define one or more `channels` as `input` and `output`. The interaction between these processes,
and ultimately the pipeline execution flow itself, is implicitly defined by these `input` and `output` declarations.

=== Execution abstraction

While a `process` defines _what_ command or `script` has to be executed, the executor determines
how that `script` is actually run in the target platform.

If not otherwise specified, processes are executed on the local computer. The local executor
is very useful for pipeline development and testing purposes, but for real world computational
pipelines, an HPC or cloud platform is often required.

In other words, Nextflow provides an abstraction between the pipeline's functional logic and
the underlying execution system (or runtime). Thus it is possible to write a pipeline once and to seamlessly
run it on your computer, a cluster, or the cloud, without modifying it, by simply defining
the target execution platform in the configuration file.

=== Scripting language

Nextflow implements a declarative domain specific language (DSL) that simplifies the writing 
of complex data analysis workflows as an extension of a general purpose programming language.

This approach makes Nextflow very flexible, because it allows in the same
computing environment the benefits of a concise DSL allowing the handling of
recurrent use cases with ease *and* the flexibility and power of a general purpose
programming language to handle corner cases, which may be difficult to implement using
a purely declarative approach.

In practical terms, Nextflow scripting is an extension of the https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy programming language],
which in turn is a super-set of the Java programming language. Groovy can be considered as Python for Java in that
it simplifies the writing of code and is more approachable.


== Your first script

Here you will execute your first Nextflow script (hello.nf), which we will go through line by line. 

=== Nextflow code (hello.nf)

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

params.greeting  = 'Hello world!'
greeting_ch = Channel.from(params.greeting)

process splitLetters {

    input:
    val x from greeting_ch

    output:
    file 'chunk_*' into letters_ch

    """
    printf '$x' | split -b 6 - chunk_
    """
}

process convertToUpper {

    input:
    file y from letters_ch.flatten()

    output:
    stdout into result_ch

    """
    cat $y | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]' 
    """
}

result_ch.view{ it }
----

=== Line-by-line description

* *1*: The code begins with a shebang which declares Nextflow as the interepreter.

* *3*: Declares a parameter `greeting` that is initialized with the value 'Hello world!'.

* *4*: Initalises a `channel` labelled `greeting_ch`, which contains the value from `params.greeting`.

* *6*: Begins the first process defined as `splitLetters`.

* *8*: Input declaration for the `splitLetters` process.

* *9*: Tells the `process` to expect an input value (`val`) `from` the channel `greeting_ch`, that we assign to the variable 'x'. 

* *11*: Output declaration for the `splitLetters` process.

* *12*: Tells the process to expect output file/s (`file`) containing 'chunk_*' as output from the script and send the files to the `channel` `letters_ch`. 

* *14*: Triple quote marks intiate the code block to execute in this `process`.

* *15*: Code to execute, printing the `input` value x (called using the dollar [$] symbol prefix), and splitting the string into chunks of 6 characters long ("Hello " and "world!") and saving to files: chunk_aa and chunk_ab.

* *16*: Triple quote marks the end of the code block.

* *17*: End of first process block.

* *19*: Begin second process defined as `convertToUpper`.

* *21*: Input declaration for the `convertToUpper` `process`.

* *22*: Tells the `process` to expect `input` file/s (`file`; e.g. chunk_aa and chunk_ab) from the `letter_ch`, that we assign to the variable 'y'. 

TIP: The use of the operator `.flatten()` here is to split the two files into two separate items to be put through the next process (else they would treat them as a single element).

* *24*: Output declaration for the `convertToUpper` process.

* *25*: Tells the process to expect output as standard output (stdout) and direct this `into` the `result_ch` channel.

* *27*: Triple quote marks intiate the code block to execute in this `process`.

* *28*: Script to read files (cat) using the '$y' input variable, then pipe to uppercase conversion, outputting to standard output.

* *29*: Triple quote marks the end of the code block.

* *30*: End of first `process` block.

* *32*: The final output (in the `result_ch`) is printed to screen using the `view` operator (appended onto the channel name). 

=== In practise

Please now copy the following example into your favourite text editor 
and save it to a file named `hello.nf`.

Execute the script by entering the following command in your terminal:

[source,cmd]
----
nextflow run hello.nf
----

The output will look similar to the text shown below:

[source,cmd]
----
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 21.04.3
Launching `hello.nf` [confident_kowalevski] - revision: a3f5a9e46a
executor >  local (3)
[0d/59d203] process > splitLetters (1)   [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[9f/1dd42a] process > convertToUpper (2) [100%] 2 of 2 ✔
HELLO 
WORLD!
----

Where the standard output shows (line by line): 

* *1*: The Nextflow version executed.

* *2*: The script and version names.

* *3*: The executor used (in the above case: local).

* *4*: The first `process` executed once (1). Starting with a unique hexadecimal (see TIP below) and ending with percent and job complete information. 

* *5*: The second process` executed twice (2).

* *6-7*: Followed by the printed result string from stdout.

TIP: The hexadecimal numbers, like `0d/59d203`, identify the unique process
execution. These numbers are also the prefix of the directories where each
process is executed. You can inspect the files produced by changing to the directory
`$PWD/work` and using these numbers to find the process-specific
execution path.

IMPORTANT: The second process runs twice, executing in two different work directories 
for each input file. Therefore, in the previous example the work directory [9f/1dd42a] 
represents just one of the two directories that were processed. To print all the 
relevent paths to screen, use the `-ansi-log` flag (e.g. `nextflow run hello.nf -ansi-log false`).

It's worth noting that the process `convertToUpper` is executed in
parallel, so there's no guarantee that the instance processing the first
split (the chunk 'Hello ') will be executed before the one
processing the second split (the chunk 'world!').

Thus, it is perfectly possible that you will get the final result
printed out in a different order:

[source,cmd]
....
WORLD!
HELLO
....

== Modify and resume

Nextflow keeps track of all the processes executed in your pipeline. If
you modify some parts of your script, only the processes that are
actually changed will be re-executed. The execution of the processes
that are not changed will be skipped and the cached result used instead.

This helps when testing or modifying part of your pipeline without
having to re-execute it from scratch.

For the sake of this tutorial, modify the `convertToUpper` process in
the previous example, replacing the process script with the string
`rev $y`, so that the process looks like this:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
process convertToUpper {

    input:
    file y from letters.flatten()

    output:
    stdout into result

    """
    rev $y
    """
}
----

Then save the file with the same name, and execute it by adding the
`-resume` option to the command line:

[source,cmd]
----
nextflow run hello.nf -resume
----

It will print output similar to this:

[source,cmd]
----
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 21.04.3
Launching `hello.nf` [admiring_venter] - revision: aed50861e0
executor >  local (2)
[74/d48321] process > splitLetters (1)   [100%] 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
[59/136e00] process > convertToUpper (1) [100%] 2 of 2 ✔
!dlrow
 olleH
----

You will see that the execution of the process `splitLetters` is
actually skipped (the process ID is the same), and its results are
retrieved from the cache. The second process is executed as expected,
printing the reversed strings.

TIP: The pipeline results are cached by default in the directory `$PWD/work`.
Depending on your script, this folder can take of lot of disk space.
If you are sure you won't resume your pipeline execution, clean this folder periodically.


== Pipeline parameters

Pipeline parameters are simply declared by prepending to a variable name
the prefix `params`, separated by a dot character. Their value can be
specified on the command line by prefixing the parameter name with a
double dash character, i.e. `--paramName`

Now, let's try to execute the previous example specifying a different input string parameter, as shown below:

[source,cmd]
----
nextflow run hello.nf --greeting '!odnum !aloH'
----

The string specified on the command line will override the default value
of the parameter. The output will look like this:

[source,cmd]
----
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 21.04.3
Launching `hello.nf` [serene_carlsson] - revision: aed50861e0
executor >  local (3)
[71/974e5d] process > splitLetters (1)   [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[06/206ffa] process > convertToUpper (1) [100%] 2 of 2 ✔
Hola! 
mundo!
